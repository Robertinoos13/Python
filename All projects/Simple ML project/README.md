# Script Name
## 🧠 Simple Machine Learning

---

## 📄 Description
This script is a **basic Machine Learning model** that learns how to perform **simple math operations**, such as `2 + 3`.  
It's a great starting point for understanding how neural networks learn from examples!

---

## 🖥️ Output
After training, the script outputs the ML model's **performance** and allows it to perform additions based on **two user-given inputs**.

---

## 📚 Required Libraries
To run this script, you'll need the following Python library:
- `pytorch` (a.k.a. `torch`)

Make sure it's installed using pip:
```bash
pip install torch
```

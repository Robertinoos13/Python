Hey, hey you!

Welcome to my reposity! If you are new here and you dont know what is with the folders from this reposity, please read me a bit.

# The folder "All Projects"
- Here will be added all python projects/scripts maked by @Robertinoos13
- So if you only interesed only for Python scripts, take a look in this folder and watch any script, what your heart wants 

# The folder "mp3 files"
- Some scripts form "All Projects" folder needs to play a song, so here you can 'steal' a mp3 file from here and put in the respective script (using a path) if you dont have a mp3 file aready in your PC

# The file ".gitattributes"
- You can ignore this file, its a file from GitHub and its not so important like "All Projects" folder

# Other "readme.txt" files
- Describes other folders and/or the content from respective folder to understand this reposity much better

# More

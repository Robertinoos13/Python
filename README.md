# Welcome to My Repository! 🎉

Hey, hey you! 👋 Welcome to my repository! If you're new here and don't understand what the folders in this repo are for, read below. 📚

---

## 📁 The folder "All Projects"
- Here you will find all Python projects/scripts made by [@Robertinoos13](https://github.com/Robertinoos13).
- If you are only interested in Python scripts, take a look in this folder and explore any script you like. 🧐

---

## 🎵 The folder "mp3 files"
- Some scripts from the "All Projects" folder need to play a song, so you can find mp3 files here to use.
- If you don't already have an mp3 file on your PC, download it from this folder and add it to the respective script (using an appropriate path).

---

## ⚙️ The file ".gitattributes"
- You can ignore this file; it is generated automatically by GitHub and is not as important as the "All Projects" folder.

---

## 📄 Other "readme.txt" files
- They describe other folders and/or their content to help you better understand this repo.
